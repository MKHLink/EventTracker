Add Date Screen: Allows users to add new events and dates using a form.
SMS Permission Screen: Requests necessary permissions for SMS notifications, users can allow or deny said permission.

# Coding Approach
The development was done in phases of planning, coding and testing. Various conditional checks were put in place for SMS permissions and fields verification. For user interaction, event-driven programming is used.

# Testing
Tetsing involved the use of Andriod Emulator to simulate user interactions and various rigourous testing were used to verifiy data integrity and CRUD methods. 

# Overcoming Challenges
Setting up the Andriod Emulator was a bit challenging as it kept having memory issues. Setting up correct SMS permission handling was a bit tricky too, was tetsing it required a complete reset of the emulator.

# Skills Demonstrated
CRUD funtionality, app connection with built in database, SMS Permission setting and good UI design.
